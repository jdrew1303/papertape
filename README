INTRODUCTION

    Papertape allows creation and manipulation of punched paper tape
    image files, for use with vintage computer and teletype systems.
    It is written in Python, and provides both a Python package and
    various utility scripts.

    The primary utility script for image manipulation is tapeutil.py.
    Invoke tapeutil.py with the '-h' or '--help' option for
    instructions.

    Other utilities allow communication with paper tape reader and
    punching hardware.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

    Any system with a compatible Python installation should be able to
    run tapeutil.py. Papertape was developed and tested under Python
    2.7.

    The tapein.py script may not work on Windows systems because of
    their different handling of ^C signaling.
     

INSTALLATION

    Use the setup.py script to install papertape. Here are some usage
    examples:

    Install in your user directory:
        ./setup.py install --user

    Install in the system default location:
        sudo ./setup.py install

    Install under /usr/local:
