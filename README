INTRODUCTION

    Papertape is a suite of tools inspired by the bcd(1) program that
    was included in many BSD UNIX distributions. Like bcd(1), the
    papertape suite generates visual representations of punched paper
    tape. The papertape suite not only generates an ASCII art
    representation; it also generates graphical images in PBM (Portable
    Bitmap) format.

    The author originally wrote this code to generate a graphical
    representation of punched paper tape as a page banner on his web
    page. Though that banner is now long gone, this tool suite is
    released in the hope that it may be useful. The PBM output is a
    plain monochrome image, but it can be used as a starting point for
    artistic modifications in tools such as gimp or Photoshop.
